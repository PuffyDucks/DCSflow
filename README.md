## Description

There are 2 methods simulating phonon spectrum and convert into inelastic neutron scattering spectrum

## Documentation

1. 2 Methods for simulating INS spectrum. One is finite displacement method (FD) and the other is molecular dynamics method (MD). The theory of these 2 methods are written in next section. 

2. There are 2 calculators in DCS-flow, one is VASP and the other is DFTB+.

## Theory

1. Finite Displacement Method (Phonopy)

2. Molecular Dynamics Method
